## FlowsInside: Intracellular Flux Balance Analysis Addon

FlowsInside is an intracellular Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) addon designed to integrate with agent-based modeling platforms such as PhysiCell. It provides a biologically grounded way to couple genome-scale metabolic models with dynamic cell simulations, allowing cells to compute metabolic fluxes internally and influence their growth, proliferation, and survival.

✨ Features

🔬 Intracellular Metabolism: Connects FBA models to individual cells in agent-based simulations.

⚡ Efficient Optimization: Built with GLPK for linear programming support.

🔄 Dynamic Coupling: Biomass flux can drive cell-cycle progression, volume increase, or custom behaviors.

🧩 Modular Integration: Works as a plugin; easily adaptable to new agent-based frameworks.

📂 File-based Models: Load genome-scale metabolic models: MATLAB .mat file.

🚀 Installation

Make sure you have:

GLPK and Matio Libraries.
